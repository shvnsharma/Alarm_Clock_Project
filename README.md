This project uses html, css and javascript to create a alarm clock, which contains following features:

Features
Clock face
Clock showing the current time (seconds,mins,hrs should change as time changes)

Set Alarm
Provide input boxes to set an alarm (hr,min,sec, am/pm)
Once the sets the time and click “Set Alarm” button, add that alarm to the alarms list below
When the alarm rings we can click on cancel button highlighted to stop the alam, once the cancel button adjacent to alam ringing is click it pops up and alert and stops the alam and removes it from the list of alams set.

Alarms list
Display a list of all the alarms set by user
Delete alarm
For each alarm give a delete button to delete the alarm
When the user deletes an alarm make sure it “does not alerts the user”

Note:
As of now no restriction has been applied to the input box and we need to enter the time in hh:mm:ss format.
Also, no restriction has been added for adding duplicate alarms.
These will be enhanced in future.
